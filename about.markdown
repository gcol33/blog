## About

I'm Gilles Colling, a statistician interested in probability theory, Bayesian inference, and the mathematics underlying statistical methods.

This blog explores ideas in statistics and mathematics, from measure-theoretic foundations to everyday paradoxes. Posts aim to be rigorous but accessible, often connecting modern concepts to their historical origins.

## Notation

Posts on this blog use standard mathematical notation:

- Random variables: capital letters ($X$, $Y$, $Z$)
- Parameters: Greek letters ($\beta$, $\theta$, $\lambda$, $\sigma$)
- Expectations: $\mathbb{E}[X]$
- Variance: $\mathrm{Var}(X)$
- Probability: $P(A)$ or $\Pr(A)$
- Distributions: $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, $\text{Uniform}(a,b)$, $\text{Poisson}(\lambda)$
