## Introduction

This is an example draft. Drafts don't need a date in the filename.

To preview drafts locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
```

When ready to publish, move this file to `_posts/` and rename with date prefix:
```
_drafts/example-draft.md  →  _posts/2025-01-15-example-draft.md
```
